##Forever Chat iMessage Export

##What

This module reads from the google takeout hangouts json and provides you with an output in the [forever chat format](http://github.com/jkeen/forever-chat-format)

##To Do

It would be great to get a sample json file committed for testing purposes. I'm using my own for local testing, but I'm not sharing years of chats to the public internet, thankyouverymuch. If somebody comes across this and is willing to donate their own, or create a dummy one that has examples of individual chats, group chats, attachments, and links, that would be amazing.
